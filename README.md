# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains multiple projects focusing on various machine-learning tasks. Each project has its own folder and may cover topics like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and data preprocessing.

## Repository Structure
- **Project Folders**: Each folder represents a distinct machine learning project.
  - **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - **Scripts**: Python scripts for utility functions and additional processing.
  - **Data**: Datasets used for the projects (if applicable).
  - **Models**: Saved machine learning models or other outputs.
  - **Results**: Outcomes and visualizations from model training and evaluation.
  - **Requirements**: Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file to specify dependencies.

## Repository Contents
- [US Income Prediction](./US%20Income%20Prediction): Random Forest Classification model with detailed EDA as well as Visualizations. It includes complex functions for Weighted Chi-Square, Cramer's V, Point Biserial, and using sample weights in the model as well as analysis.
- [Yelp Regression](./Yelp%20Regression): A guided Linear Regression project for Beginners. Helps in skilling in Pandas commands, Data Cleaning, Correlation Heatmap, Scatterplots, Feature Selection, Train Test Split, Model training, and accuracy based on RÂ².

## Getting Started
To set up this repository and run the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souravjain122/machine_learning.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated from other projects:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows users: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the project folder of interest and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd "Project Name"  # Replace with the desired project folder
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
   Open the Jupyter notebooks within each project folder to explore the analysis, model training, and evaluation:
   ``` bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
